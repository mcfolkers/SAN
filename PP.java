/*
 * PP.java
 * Assignment for the Path planning part of the ZSB lab course.
 *
 * This you will work on writing a function called highPath() to move a
 * chesspiece across the board at a safe height. By raising the gripper 20 cm
 * above the board before moving it over the board you don't risk hitting any
 * other pieces on the board. This means you don't have to do any pathplanning
 * yet.
 *
 * Input of this program is a commandline argument, specifying the computer 
 * (white) move. Your job is to find the correct sequence of GripperPositions
 * (stored in Vector p) to pick up the correct white piece and deposit it at
 * its desired new location. Read file
 * /opt/stud/robotics/hints/HIGHPATH_POSITIONS to see what intermediate
 * positions you should calculate.
 *
 * To run your program, fire up playchess or one of its derviates endgame* and
 * the umirtxsimulator. In the simulator you can see the effect of your path
 * planning although the board itself is not simulated. When you think you've
 * solved this assignment ask one of the lab assistents to verify it and let
 * it run on the real robot arm.
 * 
 * You can also compare your solution with the standard PP solution outside
 * playchess by running in a shell:
 * java PPstandard e2e4
 * cat positions.txt
 * java PP e2e4
 * cat positions.txt
 *
